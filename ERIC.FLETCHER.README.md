***---
All of my files are bike-app.component...
They were all created with the ng generate component command line.

**Create Service**
1.	Create a new service to fetch live data from https://feeds.citibikenyc.com/stations/stations.json using Angularâ€™s http service.
2.	Hook the new service up to a second copy of your component.

I was unable to get my project to work, there was many variations and I'm not sure what I'm missing. I belive I have just over thought it
and now am just spining in circles. But I would like to state that I understand the pathway of information.
The main info is located in app/data.ts as a raw file.
app/basic.services.ts works through the app/data.ts file using the bike-info.ts file as it's template. 
app/bike-info.ts uses the app/station-bean-enty.ts file as template to organize each "station" and the statistics for said station

To create the live data feed, I need to replace the data.ts file in basic.services.ts with the data being pulled from the feed link 
    via the Angular service. That seems like a very simple task, as basic.services.ts will continue to loop and reload itself with 
    new information that is fed to it.

**Bonus pts**: wrap the whole angular app into an electron app http://electron.atom.io/
